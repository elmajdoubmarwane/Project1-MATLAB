These are the reported Questions :


1. Print a list of all production types sorted descending by the installed capacities. Include
the name of the production type and the capacity.

2. Print a similar list but now with the total aggregated energy over the whole year.

3. Compare if the production type with the highest installed capacity also aggregated the
most energy over the whole year. If thatâ€™s not the case get the difference to the top
production type in the respective category. Create a command window output that
includes all this information (top production type, difference to top production type if not
the same, energy/capacity levels)

4. Create a plot for the production types and their installed capacities. On a second y-axis
plot the total aggregated amount over the year. Make your plot look better by using the
production type names on the x-axis.

5. Calculate the total installed capacities for renewable energy production types and for
non-renewable production types.
-> Renewable: Biomass, Geothermal, Hydro Pumped Storage, Hydro Run-of-river and
poundage, Hydro Water Reservoir, Wind Onshore, Wind Offshore, Solar, Waste, Other
renewable
-> Not-Renewable: Fossil Brown coal, Fossil Gas, Fossil Hard coal, Fossil Oil, Nuclear,
Other
Create a command window output with the results

6. Do the same thing but now with the average aggregated energy over the whole year for
each category.

7. Create one figure including two bar graph plots. The first bar graph should show the
average aggregated energy levels for each of the renewable production types. The
second one for the non-renewable production types.

9. Create a function to either read or write a double-precision vector into a binary file.
Reading or writing mode should be chosen by a input argument.
